TASKS
0. Add display flex
mandatory
Use the starter HTML and CSS files from this task to task 7. Copy the contents of the starter files into the files that you need to produce and make the necessary changes according to the task description.

When using display: flex; on a container, all direct children become flex-items (and no more inline or block elements).

With display flex, margins are not collapsing as they would with block items. Also remember that flexbox is 1-dimensional system (vs CSS Grid which is a 2 dimensional system)

In the /* Grid section within your CSS

Add a selector for the row class
Property: display, Value: flex
=> Now, all children from the row class are flex items

Entirely remove the row::after declaration
Remove the float: left inside [class*='col-']
=> All elements should appear same than before using the float

The flex-direction property says how flex items are placed on the main axis and their direction (normal or reversed).

flex-direction is sometimes used when doing responsive design. Some elements may appear better when they are in column mode on mobile and row when on desktop.

row-reverse and column-reverse should be used in specific situation. The visual order of elements should be the same visually and in the HTML code. Refer to flex-direction - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN for more information

Before /*** 4. CARD ***/, add a new comment: /* Section Latest news ============================= */
